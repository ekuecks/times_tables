Times Tables Visualization
==========================

This project shows patterns in times tables. Open up index.html in your browser
and adjust the slider (or type in a number) to see the times tables for that
value. Natural numbers are more uniform (note the pattern of n-1 circles for
multiplier n).

What
----
The circle is broken up into 200 equal segments each corresponding to a number
0-199. For each number, multiply the value of the slider by that value and then
do modulo 200. Connect these 2 points.

Why
---
I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8) and thought
it was neat and wanted a way to play around with it.

This looks rushed and ugly

I'm lazy.
